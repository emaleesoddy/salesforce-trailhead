# hittin' the salesforce trails
hi there! üëãüèª

this is where i play with and explore salesforce engineering. mainly it's trailhead challenges and superbadges, but at times i may put together some proof-of-concepts.

## branching structure
`main` is a representation of completed & merged code, i.e. "production"

`playground/` is the current trailhead playground i am working in; my "development" branch.

`cert-maintenance/` is the work required to complete a certification maintenance module

`module/` is the module i am working on.

`superbadge/` is the badge i am working on.

due to the nature of this repo, i don't delete the branches after my personal PRs or merges.
